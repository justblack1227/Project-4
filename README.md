#Project 4 
  With this project, a static form will be transformed into an interactive one.
  In here you will find:
   - Javascript Object-Oriented functionality and syntax
   - Two class files interacting with one another and the DOM.
   - Vanilla javascript that doesn't use the snippets or plugins.
   - Uses of CSS Selectors
