Guessing Game App
  With this project, a guessing-game app will be created to guess hidden phrases.
  In here you will find:
   - Javascript Object-Oriented functionality and syntax
   - Two class files interacting with one another and the DOM.
   - Vanilla javascript that doesn't use the snippets or plugins.
   - Uses of CSS Selectors
